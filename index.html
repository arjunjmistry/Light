        <p1 class=welcomeText>Thank you for participating. Please note this experiment will only work using GOOGLE CHROME. The experiment will take approximately 1 hour to complete, you may take short breaks in between (no more than 10 minutes) if you wish. During the experiment you will be shown 72 randomly ordered animations; the first two will be practice rounds followed by the experiment. In each video a cyclist will appear, cycle up the road, and at some point change speed. Once you are confident you have seen the bicycle, you should immediately click the detection button, once you are confident you have seen the bicycle change speed, you should immediately click the change speed button. Following each round you will rate the difficulty of the task in a short questionnaire. Afterwards. when all videos have been shown, you will be able to download a results file which you will then need to send to the researcher either on arjunjmistry@hotmail.com or via social messenger. Press continue to see an instructional walkthrough.</p1>
